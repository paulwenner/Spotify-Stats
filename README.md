Top Tracks and Artists: Displays user's top tracks and artists over different time periods.
Listening Habits: Analysis of listening habits including genres, playlists, and activity patterns.
Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Spotify Web API: To fetch user data and statistics from Spotify.
HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript: For structuring and styling the frontend.
Bootstrap: For responsive design elements.
